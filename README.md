# CSGO-Trigger-Bot
A CS:GO Trigger Bot using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

This uses [TBVGG3](https://github.com/TFNN/TBVGG3) and is based on work by [James William Fletcher](https://github.com/mrbid).

```
L-CTRL + L-ALT = Toggle BOT ON/OFF
R-CTRL + R-ALT = Toggle HOTKEYS ON/OFF
P = Toggle crosshair.
G = Get activation for reticule area.
H = Hold pressed to print scans per second.

Make the crosshair a single green pixel.
OR disable the game crosshair and use the crosshair provided by this bot.
OR if your monitor provides a crosshair use that. (this is best)

This bot will only auto trigger when W,A,S,D & L-SHIFT are not being pressed.
(so when your not moving in game, aka stationary)

L-SHIFT allows you to disable the bot while stationary if desired.

This dataset is trained only on Counter-Terrorist heads
so you need to play as Terrorist forces.
